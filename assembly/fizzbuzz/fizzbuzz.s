# PURPOSE:
        # Loop from numbers 1 to 100.
        # Print "fizz" if a number is divisible by 3.
        # Print "buzz" if a number is divisible by 5.
        # Print "fizzbuzz" if a number is divisible by 3 and 5.
        # Print the number in all other cases.
# INPUT: None.
# OUTPUT:
        # Print newline separated strings to stdout.
        # Return a status code of 0.
# VARIABLES:
